# Airlines Customer Experience: <br/>

Included information about airlines passengers’ customer experience. <br/>

The features were consisted of both a passenger’s details (age, gender, and airline membership information) <br/>

and that passenger’s related flight details (origin, destination, delay in departure, delay at arrival). <br/>

The goal for these two projects is to predict what factors shall increase the passengers’ <br/>

tendency to become more ‘promoter’ and less ‘neutral’ and ‘detractors’ (these statuses are a function of the Net Promoter Score). <br/>

Group Project <br/>

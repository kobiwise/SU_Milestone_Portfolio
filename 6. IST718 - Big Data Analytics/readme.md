# Used Vehicles Buying:

The data file included many features regarding the vehiclesâ€™ characteristics (manufacturer, car type, engine, fuel consumption, gear type etc.) <br/>
and the listing itself (posting date, number of previous owners and offered price). Using various models, <br/>
we were able to predict listing price and number of days to remain on the market with supervised models, <br/>
as well as identifying patterns within the listings using unsupervised models. <br/>
